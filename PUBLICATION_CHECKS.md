# Publication checks

Source snapshot: 2026-09-12. Windows x86_64 checks against this publication tree.

cargo test --workspace --locked --offline passed: 49 tests.

GUI frontends and PLITA are deferred. Build products, private inputs and generated ROMs are excluded from Git. This packaging pass does not claim physical-hardware validation.

## Windows CLI executable distribution - 2026-09-13

A fresh CLI-only Release executable is included at the repository root.
The build uses the locked dependencies, x86_64-pc-windows-msvc and static CRT.
Current binary hashes and executed checks are recorded in `BINARY_BUILD.json`.
These checks are separate from the earlier workspace test totals.
The independent code is licensed by DAISUKE OBA. Original dependency notices
are bundled; GUI executables and private ROMs/data are not distributed.
